Customer Report
===============================================================

Purpose:
 - This report consolidates key customer metrics and behaviors

Highlights:
 1. Gathers essential fields such as names, ages, and transaction details.
 2. Segments customers into categories (VIP, Regular, New) and age groups.
 3. Aggregates customer-level metrics:
    - total orders
    - total sales
    - total quantity purchased
    - total products
    - lifespan (in months)
 4. Calculates valuable KPIs:
    - recency (months since last order)
    - average order value
    - average monthly spend
